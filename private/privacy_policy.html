  <h1>Samoa Weather Application Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: Aug-4, 2017</p>
  <p>Samoa Meteorology Division ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Samoa Weather application ("App" hereafter).
    This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from the users of the App.</p>
  <h3>Information Collection And Use</h3>
  <p>
    While using our App, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information").
    The App does not collect any Personal Information without asking users to provide.
  </p>

  <h3>Log Data</h3>
  <p>In order to trace successful delivery of warning messages, the app generates a temporary identity
    and logs the reception time of the waring messages associated to the temporary identity.
    The logged data will be used for service improvement.
  </p>

  <p>In addition, we may use third party services that collect, monitor, and analyze our App's performance and stability, for service improvement.

  <h3>Disclosure</h3>
  <p>We may disclose the logged data.
    The logged data is statistically processed before disclosure
    , so that each individual user cannot be identified even if the disclosed data is combined with data from other information sources.</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>

  <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

  <h3>Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of Aug-7, 2017 and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

  We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the App after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.
