  <h1>Multi Hazard Early Warning System Application Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    This application does not collect any information that can identify the user of the application by itself
    , such as phone number, device identify, and e-mail address.
  </p>

  <p>In order to trace successful delivery of warning messages, the app generates a temporary identity
    and collects the reception time of the waring messages associated to the temporary identity.
    The collected information will be used for service improvements and may be published.
    The data is statistically processed before the publication
    , so that each individual user is kept anonymized even if the published data is combined with other information sources.
  </p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly if the future update of the application requires collection of user's information
    for providing a better service.
  </p>
